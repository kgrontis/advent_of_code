# Advent of Code Solutions
Welcome to my Advent of Code solutions repository! Here, you'll find my solutions to the challenges presented in the Advent of Code programming puzzles. Each folder corresponds to a specific day.

## About
Advent of Code is an annual coding event that challenges participants with a series of two-part programming puzzles, one for each day in December leading up to Christmas. The challenges cover a variety of topics, including algorithms, data structures, and problem-solving skills. 
This repository contains my solutions to these challenges, written in C#.
